    The Free Colonies, an aspiring independence movement, was attempting to liberate a prison colony.
After gathering enough intel on the colony, and seeing how many armored vehicles the guards
were equipped with, the FC decided that they would need some armor of their own to counter them.
Unfortunately all they could do was smuggle some low-tech weapons and old surplus industrial walkers.
So the FC welded and hammered these rust buckets back together and they have been a staple part of
the movement ever since.
